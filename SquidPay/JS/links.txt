Time Tracking Integration
Select payroll software that includes a time tracking feature or can seamlessly connect with your existing time tracking software, particularly if you employ hourly workers. This integration eliminates the necessity for manual data entry, resulting in improved overall efficiency and accuracy.

Employee Self-Service
Employee self-service offers two primary benefits. It allows employees to access their vacation balances, pay stubs, and W-2 forms directly, as well as make certain profile changes independently, like updating their address or bank account information. Consequently, this shift reduces the HR team's administrative workload, enabling them to concentrate on fostering a positive company culture and promoting accountability.

Payroll Reports
It's important to be able to make and adjust payroll reports. Payroll software should come with ready-made reports for quick use. But, it's also important that you can make your own reports since every company is different. Customizable reports let you create special datasets based on what's most important for your business. Before you decide, check what kinds of reports you can make to be sure you'll get the data you need.

Krizalen Enterprise Payroll with Biometric System
According to the researchers Alvarez, Aldrine, Gecolea (2014) uses a biometrics with online data analytics dashboard to give krizalen enterprises an efficient payroll system that can automatically monitor the attendance and trip tickets of the employees, drivers and helpers with the biometrics technology and data analytics that would help them in the security and accuracy of the company payroll and information. Summing up the past situation of payroll inside krizalen enterprises, there was need for a system that could help them with employee information management attendance, monitoring, payroll processes, and assistance for the manager decision making. With this idea, the proponents conducted a study for the development of software that can minimize data redundancy, inconsistency, and manipulation. Employees can view their current pay and review their information from the database. And with updating of the reports that can be viewed through the internet, the manager can view the recent activities within the proposed system (www.scribd.com).
